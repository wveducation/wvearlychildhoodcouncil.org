# About this Project

This is the main website for the [Early Childhood Advisory Council](http://wvearlychildhoodcouncil.org) of West Virginia.

Originally, a [full Wordpress installation](https://github.com/wveducation/wvearlychildhoodcouncil.org_wp) hosted on a dedicated server ran this site. We transitioned to this statically-built site deployed on Github Pages (for free).
