* Young children need proper nutrition to support strong brain development before birth and in the first three years. 
* The correct nutrients are in foods rich in protein, iron, zinc, calcium, fiber, and essential vitamins.  
* Proper nutrition helps strengthen a child's neural connections and impacts physical development and growth.
* Learning the foods associated with a proper diet is essential to help a child's brain develop.
* Lack of adequate nutrition hinders physical growth and negatively impacts a child's healthy brain development.  
* Poor nutrition, lack of physical activity, and large amounts of screen time (including access to computers, electronic devices, television, and/or video games) can contribute to childhood obesity, negatively impacting brain development.  
* When children participate in preparing healthy foods, they are more likely to try new foods and establish lifelong good eating habits.
* Helping kids make healthy nutrition choices doesn't have to be strenuous. For example, the **5210 Program** can help. Every day, stick to the numbers 5, 2, 1, and 0 (see below) to encourage an active, healthy lifestyle. For more information, visit [https://keys4healthykids.org/5210](https://keys4healthykids.org/5210).
  * 5 servings of fruits and veggies
  * 2 hours or less of screen time 
  * 1 hour of physical activity 
  * 0 sugary drinks
