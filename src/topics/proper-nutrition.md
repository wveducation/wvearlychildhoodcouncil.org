Movement and engaging experiences not only build a young child’s healthy body, but also strong brain connections. In order for the brain to make connections and grow, physical movements and engaging experiences with a caring adult must be a part of a child’s daily routine.  Developing brains need body movement in safe environments. Research suggests that when children use their large and small muscles to explore their surroundings, they are making brain connections that increase memory, language, attention, and social and emotional development.  When we engage in physical activity, more oxygen is supplied to our brains.  With more oxygen, our brains are at their best.  Here are some things to keep in mind when providing opportunities for physical development and engaging experiences with children in the first thousand days of children’s lives:  

* Babies need _tummy time_.  Tummy time is time spent on the tummy with a supervising caregiver.  It is the first exercise and crucial for brain and muscle development.
* Young children need to have opportunities to cross the midline (middle of the child’s body from head to feet).  When children cross the midline, both sides of the brain are making connections.  Crossing the midline occurs at around four months of age and improves muscles control and later improves cognitive skills and reading.  
* Children are naturally equipped to move and explore; however, they must also feel secure enough to take appropriate risks in their environments.  Children feel safe and connected when they are engaged with a caring adult. 
* Children need opportunities to use their senses to explore the environment using their large and small muscles. Large muscles are those that are used to crawl, run, jump, and throw and catch a ball.  Small muscles are those used for grasping, holding, drawing, and writing.  
* Playing with young children outdoors is one of the best ways to provide opportunities for physical development.  
* Understanding typical developmental milestones can help parents monitor their child’s progress.  Parents can talk with their child’s doctor when there are concerns.  The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides developmental milestone for children ages two months to five years.
