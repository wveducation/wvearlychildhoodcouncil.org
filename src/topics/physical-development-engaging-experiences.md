## Movement

Movement and engaging experiences build a young child’s healthy body and strong brain connections. For the brain to make connections and grow, physical movements and engaging experiences with a caring adult must be part of a child’s daily routine. Body movement in safe environments is great for a developing brain. Research suggests that when children use their large and small muscles to explore their surroundings, they make brain connections that increase memory, language, attention, and social and emotional development. Oxygen is supplied to our brains throughout physical activity and more oxygen means our brains are at their best. Here are some things to keep in mind when providing opportunities for physical development and engaging experiences with children in the first one thousand days of a child's life:  
* Babies need **tummy time**. 
  * Time spent on the tummy with a supervising caregiver. It is the first exercise and is crucial for brain and muscle development.

## Crossing the Midline

Young children need to have opportunities to cross the midline (middle of the child’s body from head to feet). As children cross the midline, both sides of the brain make connections. This occurs around four months of age and improves muscle control, cognitive skills and reading later in life. 

Children naturally enjoy moving and exploring; however, they must also feel secure enough to take appropriate risks in their environments and feel connected when engaged with a caring adult. Children need opportunities to use their senses to explore the environment using their large and small muscles. Large muscles control crawling, running, jumping, and throwing or catching a ball. Small muscles control grasping, holding, drawing, and writing. Playing outdoors with young children is one of the best ways to provide opportunities for physical development.  

Understanding typical developmental milestones can help parents monitor their child’s progress. Parents can talk with their child’s doctor when there are concerns. 

* The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides [developmental milestones](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/actearly/milestones/index.html) for children ages two months to five years.
