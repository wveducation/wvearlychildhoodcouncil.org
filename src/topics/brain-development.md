The first thousand days (approximately the first three years) of all children’s lives are critically important, because this time period is when their brains grow and develop at an incredibly fast pace.  Experiences in the first thousand days of life create connections in young children’s brains that continue to be fine-tuned and grown throughout life.  

Even though children’s brains at birth are about a quarter of the size of an adult brain, children’s brains grow to approximately 80% of an adult-sized brain during those first thousand days of life.  Also, children are born with all the brain cells they will have for their lives.  These brain cells are ready to make networks that will lay the foundations for development and learning throughout their entire lives ([First Things First, Brain Development, 2022](https://www.firstthingsfirst.org/early-childhood-matters/brain-development/)). 

Networks are developed through the connection of neurons (which are the brain cells that send information inside the brain and to other parts of the body from the brain).  Children's brains can form strong neural connections to help ensure communication across different areas of the brain when the following consistent factors are present in their lives:

* positive experiences and attachments in safe environments; 
* attachments to responsive, caring, and substance-free adults; and
* proper nutrition. 

We know that babies and young children use their senses as they experience the world to make these connections strong and permanent so their brains can continue to grow and develop as they grow into the early childhood years past the first thousand days of life. 

As a result, the importance that everyone realizes just how important the first thousand days of all children’s lives cannot be emphasized enough, as that time frame sets the stage for success throughout life. 
The right experiences, nutrition, and environments are essential elements to ensure foundations for children’s brain development.

Each child deserves at least one responsive, caring, and substance-free adult who consistently provides a loving and safe environment, especially during the first thousand days of life.  However, the presence of environmental stressors such as poor nutrition, trauma (including abuse or neglect of any kind), or any other Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) in the first years of life negatively impact children's growth and brain development throughout their lives. 

To give West Virginia’s young children the best start for strong brain development that lasts throughout their lives, children must have the following during the first thousand days of their lives:

* Proper nutrition; 
* Opportunities for physical development and engaging experiences; and 
* Substance Abuse Prevention.
