The first one thousand days (approximately the first three years) of a child's life are critically important because their brains are growing and developing rapidly. Experiences throughout this time create connections in their brains that continue to be fine-tuned and grow throughout life.

At birth, a child brain is roughly a quarter of the size of an adult brain. A child brain grows to approximately 80% of an adult brain during the first one thousand days of life; all the brain cells a person has throughout their life are with them from birth. These brain cells are ready to make networks that will lay the foundations for development and learning throughout their lives [(First Things First, Brain Development, 2022)](https://www.firstthingsfirst.org/early-childhood-matters/brain-development/). 

## Neural Networks

Networks develop through the connection of neurons (the brain cells that send information from inside the brain throughout the body). A child's brain can form neural connections which ensure communication across different areas of the brain when the following consistent factors are present in their lives:

* Positive experiences and attachments in safe environments.
* Attachments to responsive, caring, and substance-free adults.
* Proper nutrition.

Babies and young children use their senses as they experience the world to make strong and permanent connections so their brains can continue to grow and develop into the early childhood years past the first one thousand days of life. As a result, understanding how crucial the first one thousand days of a child's life are is paramount, especially since that time frame sets the stage for success throughout life.

## Elements Positively Affecting Brain Development

The correct experiences, nutrition and environments are essential for a child's brain development. Each child deserves at least one responsive, caring and substance-free adult who consistently provides a loving and safe environment, especially during the first one thousand days of life. Environmental stressors such as poor nutrition, trauma (including abuse or neglect), or any other Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) in the first years of life negatively impact growth and brain development throughout a child's life.

To give West Virginia’s young children the best start for lifelong brain development, children must have the following during the first one thousand days of their lives:

* Proper nutrition.
* Opportunities for physical development and engaging experiences.
* Substance Abuse Prevention.
