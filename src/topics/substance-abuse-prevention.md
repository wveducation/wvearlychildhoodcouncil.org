## Effects of Substance Abuse

Substance abuse affects countless children across communities in West Virginia. Substance use disorder, per the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, is the recurrent use of alcohol and/or drugs that causes significant impairment, including health problems, disability, and failure to meet responsibilities at work, school, or home. This also includes the use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs. 

Children exposed to environments where others abuse substances face significant risks to their development. Children are much more likely to experience Adverse Child Experiences, or (ACE), due to substance abuse by a parent or caregiver. ACEs are external factors that children experience that cause toxic stress in children. ACEs may negatively impact a child’s life and health, including lifelong mental health. Substance abuse by a parent or caregiver may lead to children being exposed to other ACEs like unstable living conditions, and witnessing or experiencing violence, abuse, or neglect. Such risk factors begin before birth for children exposed to substance abuse by mothers during pregnancy.  

## Birth Defects Due to Substance Abuse

Substance use during pregnancy, breastfeeding, and parenting can profoundly affect a child’s development. The alarming increase in opioid use during pregnancy and the sharp rise in babies born with neonatal abstinence syndrome over the past decades show the urgent need to understand the complex ways exposure to substances during pregnancy affects child health outcomes. Potential issues caused after birth from substance use during pregnancy include:

*	Birth defects, which are health conditions present at birth that may change the shape or function of one or more body parts, may cause overall health problems, how the body develops, and/or how the body works.
*	Placental abruption, a condition in which the placenta separates from the wall of the uterus before birth. The placenta supplies the baby with food and oxygen through the umbilical cord. Placental abruption can cause heavy bleeding and may be deadly for both mother and baby.
*	Premature birth.
*	Low birth weight.
*	Neonatal abstinence syndrome occurs when a baby is exposed to a drug in the womb pre-birth and suffers withdrawal after birth.
*	Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, the unexplained death of a baby younger than one-year-old.
*	Substance abuse by a parent or caregiver following the child’s birth can have a negative impact on their development through a lack of appropriate care and stimulation, supervision, safety, and emotional availability.
