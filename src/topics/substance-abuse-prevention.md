Countless young children in West Virginia have been impacted to some extent by substance abuse in every community.  Substance use disorder is defined by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, or SAMHSA, as the recurrent use of alcohol and/or drugs that causes significant impairment, including health problems, disability, and failure to meet major responsibilities at work, school, or home. This includes the use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs.

Children who are exposed to environments where others abuse substances face major risks to their development.  Children are much more likely to experience Adverse Child Experiences, or ACEs, due to substance abuse by a parent or caregiver. ACEs are external factors that children experience that cause toxic stress in children.  ACEs may negatively impact a child’s life and health, including mental health throughout their lives. Substance abuse by a parent or caregiver may lead to children being exposed to other ACEs such as unstable living conditions, witnessing or experiencing violence, abuse, or neglect.  These risk factors begin before birth for children who are exposed to substance abuse by mothers during pregnancy.  

* Substance use during pregnancy, throughout breastfeeding, and while parenting has the potential to profoundly affect a child’s development in a variety of ways. 
* The alarming increase in opioid use during pregnancy and the sharp rise in babies born with neonatal abstinence syndrome over the past decades show the urgent need to better understand the complex ways in which exposure to substances during pregnancy affects child health outcomes.
* Potential issues caused after birth from substance use during pregnancy include:

  * Birth defects, which are health conditions present at birth that may change the shape or function of one or more parts of the body, may cause problems in overall health, how the body develops, and/or how the body works. 
  * Placental abruption, which is a serious condition in which the placenta separates from the wall of the uterus before birth. The placenta supplies the baby with food and oxygen through the umbilical cord. Placental abruption can cause very heavy bleeding and can be deadly for both mother and baby.
  * Premature birth. 
  * Low birthweight. 
  * Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), which occurs when a baby is exposed to a drug in the womb before birth and then goes through withdrawal after birth. 
  * Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), which is unexplained death of a baby younger than one year old.
* Substance abuse by a parent or caregiver following the child’s birth can have a negative impact on their development through a lack of appropriate care and stimulation, supervision, safety, and emotional availability.
